## Description

The SVS supports loading IR codes from the SD card which can be used to change settings and profiles on your scaler automatically using the included IR blaster cable. On this page I will be providing premade SD card files for different scalers to automatically change scaler profiles based on the active input number.

## InstructionsÔ∏è

1. Format your micro SD card as FAT32
2. Unzip the contents of this archive into the root of your SD card.
3. Power off your SVS, install the SD card and power your SVS back on. That's it!

Remember to mount your IR blaster somewhere near your scaler so it can detect the IR signals from the SVS.
