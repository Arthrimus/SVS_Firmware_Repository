<p style="margin:20px;"></p>

## Description

The SVS supports loading IR codes from the SD card which can be used to change settings and profiles on your scaler automatically using the included IR blaster cable. On this page I will be providing premade SD card files for different scalers to automatically change scaler profiles based on the active input number.

## InstructionsÔ∏è

1. Format your micro SD card as FAT32
2. Unzip the contents of this archive into the root of your SD card.
3. Power off your SVS, install the SD card and power your SVS back on. That's it!

Remember to mount your IR blaster somewhere near your scaler so it can detect the IR signals from the SVS.

## Retro Tink 5X Pro Profile IR Codes

### [Download](https://github.com/Arthrimus/SVS_Firmware_Repository/raw/refs/heads/main/IR%20Code%20Presets/RT5X%20IR%20Codes.zip)

### Info:
The Retro Tink 5x Pro supports 10 profiles. They can be loaded using IR Remote codes from the RT5X Pro Remote. This file contains preconfigured IR codes for profile slots 1-10 arranged in that order for input 1-10 on the SVS. These profile IR codes can be rearranged as needed by changing the name of the folders to match the input number of the input you want to assign that profile slot to.
