Version: 1.14_BETA
Date: 2025-03-09
Description:
- Added an interrupt to the control module pushbutton to cancel SD card reading and IR code transmission to speed up manual input cycling during IR code transmission sequence.
- Added a quasi-interrupt like function to the IR receiver to cancel IR code transmission, but not SD reading, to speed up manual input cycling during IR code transmission sequence. (true interrupt not feasible at this time)
- Added user defined IR code transmission delay time for SD card IR code files. (Was present in older firmware, but was temporarily removed (accidentally) in 1.13 as part of the SD card loading system rewrite)
- Added Power on/off option using the SVS IR remote and serial commands.
- Added "attract mode" option to automatically cycle through inputs at timed intervals. (Just for fun!)
- Optimized serial parser to significantly reduce dynamic memory usage. (We're running out of RAM!)
- Updated peripheral communication system's command set to reduce memory usage. (No really, we're running out of RAM!)
- Converted all 2 state variables from integer (we used to have it so easy) to Boolean to reduce memory usage.(We're pretty desperate for RAM at this point.)

Version: 1.13
Date: 2025-03-05
Description:
- Streamlined SD Card reading process for IR codes. Allows IR code sequences to be transmitted at a significantly faster interval (1.396 seconds faster per serial code slot)
- Input #0 _"no input selected"_ can now be cycled to using the control module pushbutton as well as IR and Serial Up/Down commands. Previously input cycling would roll over to input 1, skipping input 0.
- Added more serial commands to the existing serial control system.

Version: 1.12
Date: 2025-02-21
Description:
- Added 500ms delay to new input detection. This helps eliminate phantom input detection caused by occasional transient voltage spikes inside the switch
- Added USB based serial control system. Inputs can now be manually selected by passing serial commands to the SVS. See Here for details.
- Refined the peripheral communication system.

Version: 1.11_BETA
Date: 2025-02-17
Description:
- Added 500ms delay to new input detection. This helps eliminate phantom input detection caused by occasional transient voltage spikes inside the switch

Version: 1.10
Date: 2025-02-06
Description:
- Fixed factory reset bug that prevented the user programmable “input up/down” buttons from being erased during the factory reset procedure.
- Fixed IR remote bug that caused the Retro Tink 4k remote’s “Profile 1” button to trigger the “input up” function if the user programmed the Retro Tink 4K remote AUX buttons as “input up/down”.
- Optimized input detection routine, reducing flash memory usage by 13%.
- Added initial support for peripheral communication system. Needed for future modules such as the RGB to Component Conversion module.
