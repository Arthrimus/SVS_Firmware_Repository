# SVS_Firmware_Repository
This is a repository of firmware updates for the Scalable Video Switch.

Included in each firmware update zip file is the firmware update HEX file, as well as the firmware update tool for Windows. The tool is a simple batch script that automates the firmware update process through AVRDUDE.
