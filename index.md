<p style="margin:20px;"></p>

### Windows Users

1. Download the firmware update and unzip it somewhere on your computer.
2. Plug the SVS Control Module into your computer using a USB Type C Cable.
3. Run the batch file labeled "SVS Firmware Update Tool v1.0 Windows.bat"
4. The SVS Firmware Update Tool will search for the correct COM port for updating your SVS. The SVS uses a CH340 serial chip, so the firmware update tool searches for any CH340 devices and selects the first one it finds. If you have multiple CH340 devices connected at once you will need to manually select the correct COM port for your SVS.
5. The SVS Firmware Update Tool will search for the latest firmware update file in the root of the firmware update folder. If the firmware update file it selects is different than the one you want to install then you can manually type in the file name of the firmware version you wish to install as long as that file is also located in the root of your firmware update folder.
6. Once the firmware update is complete you can press any key to close the firmware update tool.

_If you are on Windows 11 and the firmware update tool does not detect your SVS you may need to install "wmic" by opening your start menu, searching for "optional features" select "View Features" search for "wmic" and install it._

### Unix Users

 Thanks to the fantastic work of [Thiaramus](https://github.com/thiaramus), the firmware update script has been ported to Unix based systems such as Linux and MacOS.

#### Linux Users

* Install AVRDUDE using your package manager:

Open a terminal and run the following command to install AVRDUDE:
`sudo apt-get install avrdude`

_For your specific Linux distribution, you may need to use a different package manager or command to install AVRDUDE.
The example above is for Ubuntu and Debian based distributions._

* Run in the terminal:
`bash SVS\ Firmware\ Update\ Tool\ v1.0\ Unix.sh`

#### Mac Users

1. Follow the instruction at [https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh) to install Brew.

2. Install AVRDUDE using Brew:
`brew install avrdude`

3. Run in the terminal:
`bash SVS\ Firmware\ Update\ Tool\ v1.0\ Unix.sh`

<p style="margin:50px;"></p>

## Version 1.15 (2025-04-09)

### [Download](https://github.com/Arthrimus/SVS_Firmware_Repository/releases/download/v1.15/SVS_Firmware_1.15.7z)

### Changelog:
- Fixed bug with autodetection on 32+ input switch setups. ***This is a required update for the expansion kit and larger than 32 input switches.***
- Fixed an order of operations bug with user defined IR code delay.
- Fixed bug with seek backwards function that could under the right circumstances cause the input number to seek to an out of range number (greater than the total number of available inputs)
- Improved seek behavior when no inputs are active. Seek will now jump to input 0 if no active inputs exist.

<p style="margin:50px;"></p>

## Version 1.14 (2025-03-11)

### [Download](https://github.com/Arthrimus/SVS_Firmware_Repository/releases/download/v1.14/SVS_Firmware_1.14.7z)

### Changelog:
- Added seek mode. Allows you to use the left/right buttons on the SVS remote to jump to the next/previous active input instead of manually cycling through all inputs one at a time. The up/down buttons still allow cycling one by one as with previous firmware versions.
- Added the ability to load a config file from the SD card to change settings such as whether the pushbutton is set to cycle inputs or seek active inputs, change the "Attract Mode" interval, and set the baudrate for the future RS232 module. [Download Config File Here](https://github.com/Arthrimus/SVS_Firmware_Repository/raw/refs/heads/main/SD%20Card%20Files/SD%20Card%20Config%20File.zip)
- Added an interrupt to the control module pushbutton to cancel SD card reading and IR code transmission to speed up manual input cycling during IR code transmission sequence.
- Added a quasi-interrupt like function to the IR receiver to cancel IR code transmission, but not SD reading, to speed up manual input cycling during IR code transmission sequence. (true interrupt not feasible at this time)
- Added user defined IR code transmission delay time for SD card IR code files. (Was present in older firmware, but was temporarily removed (accidentally) in 1.13 as part of the SD card loading system rewrite)
- Added Power on/off option using the SVS IR remote and serial commands.
- Added "attract mode" option to automatically cycle through inputs at timed intervals. Improved from 1.14 BETA version, now uses seek function to only switch between active inputs.
- Optimized serial parser to significantly reduce dynamic memory usage.
- Updated peripheral communication system's command set to reduce memory usage.
- Converted all 2 state variables from integer (we used to have it so easy) to Boolean to reduce memory usage.

## Version 1.13 (2025-03-5)

### [Download](https://github.com/Arthrimus/SVS_Firmware_Repository/releases/download/v1.13/SVS_Firmware_1.13.zip)

### Changelog:
- Streamlined SD Card reading process for IR codes. Allows IR code sequences to be transmitted at a significantly faster interval (1.396 seconds faster per serial code slot)
- Input #0 _"no input selected"_ can now be cycled to using the control module pushbutton as well as IR and Serial Up/Down commands. Previously input cycling would roll over to input 1, skipping input 0.
- Added more serial commands to the existing serial control system. [See Here for details.](serial.md)
- Added wmic deprecation warning and instructions to the firmware update script for Windows 11 users.

<p style="margin:41px;"></p>

## Version 1.12 (2025-02-21)

### [Download](https://github.com/Arthrimus/SVS_Firmware_Repository/releases/download/v1.12/SVS_Firmware_1.12.zip)

### Changelog:
- Added 500ms delay to new input detection. This helps eliminate phantom input detection caused by occasional transient voltage spikes inside the switch
- Added USB based serial control system. Inputs can now be manually selected by passing serial commands to the SVS. [See Here for details.](serial.md)
- Refined the peripheral communication system.

<p style="margin:41px;"></p>


## Version 1.10 (2025-02-06)

### [Download](https://github.com/Arthrimus/SVS_Firmware_Repository/releases/download/V1.10/SVS_Firmware_1.10_Update.7z)

### Changelog:
- Fixed factory reset bug that prevented the user programmable "input up/down" buttons from being erased during the factory reset procedure.
- Fixed IR remote bug that caused the Retro Tink 4k remote's "Profile 1" button to trigger the "input up" function if the user programmed the Retro Tink 4K remote AUX buttons as "input up/down".
- Optimized input detection routine, reducing flash memory usage by 13%.
- Added initial support for peripheral communication system. Needed for future modules such as the RGB to Component Conversion module.
